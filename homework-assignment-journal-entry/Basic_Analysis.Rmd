<!-- This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.  -->

<!-- Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.  -->

Instructions: 
Use your image to create a basic RNotebook that does the following-

    create a 5 by 10 matrix of random integers
    define column names as cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5, ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, ctrl4, ctrl5
    define row names as gene1, gene2, gene3 ...
    Compute the fold change for each gene.


```{r}
# Matrix construction
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data_matrix <- matrix(sample(1:100, 50, replace = TRUE), nrow = 5, ncol = 10)
colnames(data_matrix) <- c('cond1', 'cond2', 'cond3', 'cond4', 'cond5',
                           'ctrl1', 'ctrl2', 'ctrl3', 'ctrl4', 'ctrl5')
rownames(data_matrix) <- paste0('gene', 1:5)
data_matrix

# Assuming fold change as mean of condition columns divided by mean of control columns
cond_means <- rowMeans(data_matrix[, 1:5])
ctrl_means <- rowMeans(data_matrix[, 6:10])
fold_change <- cond_means / ctrl_means
fold_change_df <- data.frame(Gene = rownames(data_matrix), FoldChange = fold_change)
fold_change_df

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
