  abstract = {SUMMARY             The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses --- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Crohn disease (CD) burden has increased with globalization/urbanization, and the rapid rise is attributed to environmental changes rather than genetic drift. The Study Of Urban and Rural CD Evolution (SOURCE, n\,=\,380) has considered diet-omics domains simultaneously to detect complex interactions and identify potential beneficial and pathogenic factors linked with rural-urban transition and CD. We characterize exposures, diet, ileal transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiome in newly diagnosed CD patients and controls in rural and urban China and Israel. We show that time spent by rural residents in urban environments is linked with changes in gut microbial composition and metabolomics, which mirror those seen in CD. Ileal transcriptomics highlights personal metabolic and immune gene expression modules, that are directly linked to potential protective dietary exposures (coffee, manganese, vitamin D), fecal metabolites, and the microbiome. Bacteria-associated metabolites are primarily linked with host immune modules, whereas diet-linked metabolites are associated with host epithelial metabolic functions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Over the last decade, GWAS meta-analyses have used a strict P-value threshold of 5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8 to classify associations as significant. Here, we use our current understanding of frequently studied traits including lipid levels, height, and BMI to revisit this genome-wide significance threshold. We compare the performance of studies using the P\,=\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8 threshold in terms of true and false positive rate to other multiple testing strategies: (1) less stringent P-value thresholds, (2) controlling the FDR with the Benjamini--Hochberg and Benjamini--Yekutieli procedure, and (3) controlling the Bayesian FDR with posterior probabilities. We applied these procedures to re-analyze results from the Global Lipids and GIANT GWAS meta-analysis consortia and supported them with extensive simulation that mimics the empirical data. We observe in simulated studies with sample sizes {$\sim$}20,000 and \&gt;120,000 that relaxing the P-value threshold to 5\,{\texttimes}\,10-7 increased discovery at the cost of 18\% and 8\% of additional loci being false positive results, respectively. FDR and Bayesian FDR are well controlled for both sample sizes with a few exceptions that disappear under a less stringent definition of true positives and the two approaches yield similar results. Our work quantifies the value of using a relaxed P-value threshold in large studies to increase their true positive discovery but also show the excess false positive rates due to such actions in modest-sized studies. These results may guide investigators considering different thresholds in replication studies and downstream work such as gene-set enrichment or pathway analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the viability of FDR-controlling procedures in GWAS.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:               Canada has a high burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Historical trends of IBD incidence and prevalence were analyzed to forecast the Canadian burden over the next decade.                                         METHODS:               Population-based surveillance cohorts in 8 provinces derived from health administrative data assessed the national incidence (2007--2014) and prevalence (2002--2014) of IBD. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were used to forecast incidence and prevalence, stratified by age, with 95\% prediction intervals (PI), to 2035. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the forecasted incidence and prevalence.                                         RESULTS:               The national incidence of IBD is estimated to be 29.9 per 100,000 (95\% PI 28.3--31.5) in 2023. With a stable AAPC of 0.36\% (95\% CI -0.05 to 0.72), the incidence of IBD is forecasted to be 31.2 per 100,000 (95\% PI 28.1--34.3) in 2035. The incidence in pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) is increasing (AAPC 1.27\%; 95\% CI 0.82--1.67), but it is stable in adults (AAPC 0.26\%; 95\% CI -0.42 to 0.82). The prevalence of IBD in Canada was 843 per 100,000 (95\% PI 716--735) in 2023 and is expected to steadily climb (AAPC 2.43\%; 95\% CI 2.32--2.54) to 1,098 per 100,000 (95\% PI 1,068--1,127) by 2035. The highest prevalence is in seniors with IBD (1,174 per 100,000 in 2023; AAPC 2.78\%; 95\% CI 2.75--2.81).                                         DISCUSSION:               Over the next decade, the Canadian health care systems will contend with the juxtaposition of rising incidence of pediatric IBD and a rising prevalence of overall IBD driven by the aging population.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD), a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with alternating periods of exacerbation and remission, is becoming common around the world. This study aimed to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of oat beta-glucans of varying molar masses by modulating the expression of chemokines and their receptors as well as other proteins related to both stages of TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzosulfonic acid)-induced colitis, which is an animal model of CD. The experiment involved 96 Sprague--Dawley rats, which were divided into two main groups: control and TNBS-induced colitis. Both groups of rats were further divided into three dietary subgroups, which were fed with standard feed or feed supplemented with low- or high-molar-mass oat beta-glucans for 3 (reflecting acute inflammation) or 7 days (reflecting pre-remission). The gene expression of chemokines and their receptors in the colon wall was determined by RT-PCR, and the expression of selected proteins in the mucosa was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that acute and pre-remission stages of colitis were characterized by the increased gene expression of seven chemokines and four chemokine receptors in the colon wall as well as disrupted protein expression of CXCL1, CCL5, CXCR2, CCR5, and OPN in the mucosa. The consumption of oat beta-glucans resulted in decreased expression of most of these genes and modulated the expression of all proteins, with a stronger effect observed with the use of high-molar-mass beta-glucan. To summarize, dietary oat beta-glucans, particularly those of high molar mass, can reduce colitis by modulating the expression of chemokines and their receptors and certain proteins associated with CD.},
