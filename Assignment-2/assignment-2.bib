  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               IL-23 is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and myeloid cells that express Fc{$\gamma$}RI (CD64) have been identified as the primary cellular source of IL-23 in inflamed IBD gut tissue. Guselkumab (GUS) and risankizumab (RZB) are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically directed against the IL-23p19 subunit. GUS is a fully human IgG1 mAb with a native Fc region while RZB is a humanized IgG1 mAb with a mutated Fc region. Here, we evaluated CD64 and IL-23 expression in IBD patient gut biopsies, binding of GUS and RZB to CD64, and the functional consequences of CD64 binding by IL-23p19 subunit mAbs, in in vitro assays.                                         Methods               IL23A and FCGR1A (CD64) expression was analyzed from bulk and single-cell RNAseq datasets. Binding of mAbs to IFN{$\gamma$}-primed human monocytes, as well as binding to IL-23--secreting inflammatory monocytes and capture of endogenously secreted IL-23, were assessed by flow cytometry. Internalization of IL-23, GUS, and RZB within CD64+ macrophages was evaluated using live cell confocal imaging. Potency of GUS and RZB for inhibiting IL-23 signaling was determined in a co-culture of THP-1 (a CD64+ monocyte cell line activated to produce IL-23) and an IL-23 reporter cell line (measuring biologically active IL-23).                                         Results               Analysis of RNAseq datasets showed that FCGR1A, IL23A, and IL12B were significantly increased in inflamed versus non-inflamed IBD gut biopsies and that IL23A was predominantly expressed by FCGR1A-expressing myeloid cells. In in vitro assays GUS, but not RZB, showed Fc-mediated binding to CD64 on IFN{$\gamma$}-primed monocytes. CD64-bound GUS simultaneously captured IL-23 secreted from the same cells. GUS, but not RZB, bound to the surface of CD64+ macrophages and mediated internalization of IL-23 to low pH intracellular compartments. GUS and RZB demonstrated similar potency for inhibiting signaling by IL-23 present in THP-1--conditioned media. However, in a co-culture of IL-23--producing THP-1 cells with an IL-23--responsive reporter cell line, GUS demonstrated enhanced potency compared to RZB for inhibition of IL-23 signaling.                                         Conclusion               Our transcriptomic analysis supported previous observations of CD64+ myeloid cells as a key source of IL-23 production in inflamed IBD gut tissue. GUS binding to CD64 on IL-23--producing cells likely contributed to the enhanced functional potency of GUS compared to RZB for inhibition of IL-23 signaling in the co-culture assay. These in vitro data support a hypothesis for optimal enrichment of GUS in inflamed tissues where CD64+ IL-23--producing myeloid cells are increased and in proximity to IL-23--responsive lymphoid cells, enabling GUS to more potently neutralize IL-23 by targeting IL-23 at its source of production.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses --- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Fc receptors (FcRs) belong to the ITAM-associated receptor family. FcRs control the humoral and innate immunity which are essential for appropriate responses to infections and prevention of chronic inflammation or auto-immune diseases. Following their crosslinking by immune complexes, FcRs play various roles such as modulation of the immune response by released cytokines or of phagocytosis. Here, we review FcR involvement in pathologies leading notably to altered intracellular signaling with functionally relevant consequences to the host, and targeting of Fc receptors as therapeutic approaches. Special emphasis will be given to some FcRs, such as the Fc{$\alpha$}RI, the Fc{$\gamma$}RIIA and the Fc{$\gamma$}RIIIA, which behave like the ancient god Janus depending on the ITAM motif to inhibit or activate immune responses depending on their targeting by monomeric/dimeric immunoglobulins or by immune complexes. This ITAM duality has been recently defined as inhibitory or activating ITAM (ITAMi or ITAMa) which are controlled by Src family kinases. Involvement of various ITAM-bearing FcRs observed during infectious or autoimmune diseases is associated with allelic variants, changes in ligand binding ability responsible for host defense perturbation. During auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or immune thrombocytopenia, the autoantibodies and immune complexes lead to inflammation through FcR aggregation. We will discuss the role of FcRs in autoimmune diseases, and focus on novel approaches to target FcRs for resolution of antibody-mediated autoimmunity. We will finally also discuss the down-regulation of FcR functionality as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases.},

The Study Of Urban and Rural CD Evolution (SOURCE, n\,=\,380) has considered diet-omics domains simultaneously to detect complex interactions and identify potential beneficial and pathogenic factors linked with rural-urban transition and CD. We characterize exposures, diet, ileal transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiome in newly diagnosed CD patients and controls in rural and urban China and Israel. We show that time spent by rural residents in urban environments is linked with changes in gut microbial composition and metabolomics, which mirror those seen in CD. Ileal transcriptomics highlights personal metabolic and immune gene expression modules, that are directly linked to potential protective dietary exposures (coffee, manganese, vitamin D), fecal metabolites, and the microbiome. Bacteria-associated metabolites are primarily linked with host immune modules, whereas diet-linked metabolites are associated with host epithelial metabolic functions.},

Here, we use our current understanding of frequently studied traits including lipid levels, height, and BMI to revisit this genome-wide significance threshold. We compare the performance of studies using the P\,=\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8 threshold in terms of true and false positive rate to other multiple testing strategies: (1) less stringent P-value thresholds, (2) controlling the FDR with the Benjamini--Hochberg and Benjamini--Yekutieli procedure, and (3) controlling the Bayesian FDR with posterior probabilities. We applied these procedures to re-analyze results from the Global Lipids and GIANT GWAS meta-analysis consortia and supported them with extensive simulation that mimics the empirical data. We observe in simulated studies with sample sizes {$\sim$}20,000 and \&gt;120,000 that relaxing the P-value threshold to 5\,{\texttimes}\,10-7 increased discovery at the cost of 18\% and 8\% of additional loci being false positive results, respectively. FDR and Bayesian FDR are well controlled for both sample sizes with a few exceptions that disappear under a less stringent definition of true positives and the two approaches yield similar results. Our work quantifies the value of using a relaxed P-value threshold in large studies to increase their true positive discovery but also show the excess false positive rates due to such actions in modest-sized studies. These results may guide investigators considering different thresholds in replication studies and downstream work such as gene-set enrichment or pathway analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the viability of FDR-controlling procedures in GWAS.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:               Canada has a high burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Historical trends of IBD incidence and prevalence were analyzed to forecast the Canadian burden over the next decade.                                         METHODS:               Population-based surveillance cohorts in 8 provinces derived from health administrative data assessed the national incidence (2007--2014) and prevalence (2002--2014) of IBD. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were used to forecast incidence and prevalence, stratified by age, with 95\% prediction intervals (PI), to 2035. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the forecasted incidence and prevalence.                                         RESULTS:               The national incidence of IBD is estimated to be 29.9 per 100,000 (95\% PI 28.3--31.5) in 2023. With a stable AAPC of 0.36\% (95\% CI -0.05 to 0.72), the incidence of IBD is forecasted to be 31.2 per 100,000 (95\% PI 28.1--34.3) in 2035. The incidence in pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) is increasing (AAPC 1.27\%; 95\% CI 0.82--1.67), but it is stable in adults (AAPC 0.26\%; 95\% CI -0.42 to 0.82). The prevalence of IBD in Canada was 843 per 100,000 (95\% PI 716--735) in 2023 and is expected to steadily climb (AAPC 2.43\%; 95\% CI 2.32--2.54) to 1,098 per 100,000 (95\% PI 1,068--1,127) by 2035. The highest prevalence is in seniors with IBD (1,174 per 100,000 in 2023; AAPC 2.78\%; 95\% CI 2.75--2.81).                                         DISCUSSION:               Over the next decade, the Canadian health care systems will contend with the juxtaposition of rising incidence of pediatric IBD and a rising prevalence of overall IBD driven by the aging population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known about the presence and function of tissue-resident mesenchymal stem cells [MtSCs] within the gastrointestinal mucosa in health and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. The contribution of MtSCs to the generation of inflammatory fibroblasts during IBD is also poorly understood. We hypothesized that IBD-MtSCs are impaired and contribute to the generation of the pathological myofibroblasts in IBD. METHODS: In a cohort of clinically and endoscopically active IBD patients and normal controls, we used quantitative RT-PCR and stem cell differentiation assays, as well as confocal microscopy, to characterize MtSCs. RESULTS: Expression of two stem cell markers, Oct4 and ALDH1A, was increased in the inflamed IBD colonic mucosa and correlated with an increase of the mesenchymal lineage marker Grem1 in ulcerative colitis [UC], but not Crohn's disease [CD]. Increased proliferation and aberrant differentiation of Oct4+Grem1+ MtSC-like cells was observed in UC, but not in CD colonic mucosa. In contrast to normal and UC-derived MtSCs, CD-MtSCs lose their clonogenic and most of their differentiation capacities. Our data also suggest that severe damage to these cells in CD may account for the pathological PD-L1low phenotype of CD myofibroblasts. In contrast, aberrant differentiation of MtSCs appears to be involved in the appearance of pathological partially differentiated PD-L1high myofibroblasts within the inflammed colonic mucosa in UC. CONCLUSION: Our data show, for the first time, that the progenitor functions of MtSCs are differentially impaired in CD vs UC, providing a scientific rationale for the use of allogeneic MSC therapy in IBD, and particularly in CD.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Heatmap is a widely used statistical visualization method on matrix-like data to reveal similar patterns shared by subsets of rows and columns. In the R programming language, there are many packages that make heatmaps. Among them, the               ComplexHeatmap               package provides the richest toolset for constructing highly customizable heatmaps.               ComplexHeatmap               can easily establish connections between multisource information by automatically concatenating and adjusting a list of heatmaps as well as complex annotations, which makes it widely applied in data analysis in many fields, especially in bioinformatics, to find hidden structures in the data. In this article, we give a comprehensive introduction to the current state of               ComplexHeatmap               , including its modular design, its rich functionalities, and its broad applications.                        ,              Highlights                                                                Complex heatmap is a powerful visualization method for revealing associations between multiple sources of information.

Clinical manifestations are morning stiffness, pain in shoulder, neck and pelvic girdle, loss of mobility with fever, fatigue, malaise, loss of body weight, and development of rheumatoid nodules. Environmental and genetic factors are important contributors in its susceptibility. Association between RA and diet, cigarette smoking, hormones, alcohol, microbiota, infection, and coffee have also been reported. To diagnose patients with RA, American college of rheumatology (ACR, 2010) criteria, developed by European league against rheumatism (EULAR). Inflammation produced in RA patients is due to cell-mediated immune response. The rheumatoid synovium consists of a large number of CD4+ T cells suggesting pathogenic nature of T cells in this disorder. B-cells may also participate in the pathogenesis by several means such as autoantibodies, by instigation of T-cells through expression of co-stimulatory molecules, by generating pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and by organisation of other inflammatory cells. The conventional management of RA usually focuses over reducing pain and limiting the disability by medical therapies which include a number of classes of agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-biological and biological agents, disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids. However, only proper rehabilitation can promote the objective to achieve the joint functionality and ease of motion which improves independence as well as quality of life in patient suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis.},

Pathway maps are the primary dataset in KEGG representing systemic functions of the cell and the organism in terms of molecular interaction and reaction networks. The KEGG Orthology (KO) system is a mechanism for linking genes and proteins to pathway maps and other molecular networks. Each KO is a generic gene identifier and each pathway map is created as a network of KO nodes. This architecture enables KEGG pathway mapping to uncover systemic features from KO assigned genomes and metagenomes. Additional roles of KOs include characterization of conserved genes and conserved units of genes in organism groups, which can be done by taxonomy mapping. A new tool has been developed for identifying conserved gene orders in chromosomes, in which gene orders are treated as sequences of KOs. Furthermore, a new dataset called VOG (virus ortholog group) is computationally generated from virus proteins and expanded to proteins of cellular organisms, allowing gene orders to be compared as VOG sequences as well. Together with these datasets and analysis tools, new types of pathway maps are being developed to present a global view of biological processes involving multiple organism groups.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD), a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with alternating periods of exacerbation and remission, is becoming common around the world. This study aimed to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory properties of oat beta-glucans of varying molar masses by modulating the expression of chemokines and their receptors as well as other proteins related to both stages of TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzosulfonic acid)-induced colitis, which is an animal model of CD. The experiment involved 96 Sprague--Dawley rats, which were divided into two main groups: control and TNBS-induced colitis. Both groups of rats were further divided into three dietary subgroups, which were fed with standard feed or feed supplemented with low- or high-molar-mass oat beta-glucans for 3 (reflecting acute inflammation) or 7 days (reflecting pre-remission). The gene expression of chemokines and their receptors in the colon wall was determined by RT-PCR, and the expression of selected proteins in the mucosa was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that acute and pre-remission stages of colitis were characterized by the increased gene expression of seven chemokines and four chemokine receptors in the colon wall as well as disrupted protein expression of CXCL1, CCL5, CXCR2, CCR5, and OPN in the mucosa. The consumption of oat beta-glucans resulted in decreased expression of most of these genes and modulated the expression of all proteins, with a stronger effect observed with the use of high-molar-mass beta-glucan. To summarize, dietary oat beta-glucans, particularly those of high molar mass, can reduce colitis by modulating the expression of chemokines and their receptors and certain proteins associated with CD.},

Patients commonly associate their diet with symptoms and inquire about dietary modifications to manage their IBD. Without clinical guidelines and well-established nutritional data, healthcare providers managing patients with IBD may find it difficult to provide recommendations. Strong evidence for enteral nutrition, particularly in the pediatric population, has been established in Crohn's disease (CD) as a therapeutic option. Enteral nutrition may also serve as an adjunct to an exclusion diet. Recent studies such as the randomized trial comparing the Specific Carbohydrate Diet to a Mediterranean Diet in CD patients provide additional insights in forming dietary plans. A low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet in quiescent IBD and an anti-inflammatory diet have also been explored as adjunctive therapies. In this review, we discuss the latest evidence for the role of diet in IBD both as a therapeutic modality and as an opportunity to provide patient-centered care.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disorder characterized by full thickness patchy inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves defective innate immune responses, microbiome alterations, and dysregulated activation of the acquired component of mucosal immunity. One of the molecular mediators that is involved at different levels in the initiation and progression of intestinal inflammation characteristic of CD is tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The present manuscript provides a comprehensive review focused on the potential role of TNF in the different phases of CD pathogenesis, particularly in light of its potential clinical implications. Currently available drugs blocking TNF are evaluated and discussed, specifically for open issues that still remain utilizing such therapy. TNF exerts a paramount role in the established phase of intestinal inflammation that characterizes CD patients, and anti-TNF biologics have definitely changed patient management, offering effective and safe options of treatment. Nonetheless, many patients still do not respond to anti-TNF therapy or experience unwanted side-effects. This could partially be due to the role that TNF plays in intestinal homeostasis that is particularly important during the early phase of the inflammatory process. In fact, emerging evidence supporting the dichotomous role of TNF and the identification of molecular markers will guide a more tailored and refined therapy for CD patients in the near future.},

Despite the widespread use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced impact on the results, but to date their effects have received little systematic attention. Using five publicly available datasets, we demonstrated that changes in parameters such as the background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and pathway database used can result in profoundly different ORA results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways. Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most popular metabolic pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc), led to vastly different results in both the number and function of significantly enriched pathways. Factors that are specific to metabolomics data, such as the reliability of compound identification and the chemical bias of different analytical platforms also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite misidentification rates as low as 4\% resulted in both gain of false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways across all datasets. Our results have several practical implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal reporting guidelines, as a first step towards the standardisation of pathway analysis in metabolomics.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori has coexisted with humans for approximately 60,000 years and greater than 50\% of the global population is infected with H. pylori. H. pylori was successfully cultured in vitro in 1983 and studies of H. pylori have achieved substantial advances over the last 35 years. Since then, H. pylori has been characterized as the primary pathogenic factor for chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric malignancy. Numerous patients have received H. pylori eradication treatment, but only 1-2\% of H. pylori-infected individuals ultimately develop gastric cancer. Recently, numerous epidemiological and basic experimental studies suggested a role for chronic H. pylori infection in protecting against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by inducing systematic immune tolerance and suppressing inflammatory responses. Here we summarize the current research progress on the association between H. pylori and IBD, and further describe the detailed molecular mechanism underlying H. pylori-induced dendritic cells (DCs) with the tolerogenic phenotype and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). Based on the potential protective role of H. pylori infection on IBD, we suggest that the interaction between H. pylori and the host is complicated, and H. pylori eradication treatment should be administered with caution, especially for children and young adults.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the human genome has continuously expanded since its draft publication in 2001. Over the years, novel assays have allowed us to progressively overlay layers of knowledge above the raw sequence of A's, T's, G's, and C's. The reference human genome sequence is now a complex knowledge base maintained under the shared stewardship of multiple specialist communities. Its complexity stems from the fact that it is simultaneously a template for transcription, a record of evolution, a vehicle for genetics, and a functional molecule. In short, the human genome serves as a frame of reference at the intersection of a diversity of scientific fields. In recent years, the progressive fall in sequencing costs has given increasing importance to the quality of the human reference genome, as hundreds of thousands of individuals are being sequenced yearly, often for clinical applications. Also, novel sequencing-based assays shed light on novel functions of the genome, especially with respect to gene expression regulation. Keeping the human genome annotation up to date and accurate is therefore an ongoing partnership between reference annotation projects and the greater community worldwide.},
