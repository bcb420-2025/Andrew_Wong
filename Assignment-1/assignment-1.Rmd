# Introduction

Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the gastrointestinal tract, often leading to complications such as strictures, fistulas, and nutrient malabsorption [@kugathasan_2017b]. The global incidence of CD has risen sharply in recent decades [@coward_2024], particularly in urbanized regions, suggesting that environmental and dietary factors play a critical role in disease development and progression [@braun_2024; @coward_2024]. While genetic predisposition contributes to susceptibility [@kugathasan_2017b], increasing evidence highlights the impact of diet, microbiome alterations, and immune dysregulation in CD pathogenesis [@braun_2024; @coward_2024].

For this project, I sought to analyze transcriptomic data relevant to CD. To identify a suitable dataset, I searched the GEO database using the keywords “Crohn’s disease” while filtering for bulk RNA sequencing and human-derived samples. My goal was to explore how environmental exposures and diet might influence transcriptomic signatures in CD, building upon recent research linking urbanization, diet, and microbiome composition to immune and metabolic pathways associated with the disease [@braun_2024].

The dataset I selected, GSE233900, originates from the Diet-omics Study of Urban and Rural Crohn Disease Evolution (SOURCE) cohort, which examines the role of diet, microbiome, metabolomics, and transcriptomics in newly diagnosed CD patients and controls across rural and urban populations in China and Israel. This dataset is particularly compelling because it allows for the study of environmental influences on gut health, as rural-to-urban transitions appear to mirror changes seen in CD patients. By analyzing ileal transcriptomics, I aim to uncover differential gene expression patterns that may provide insight into the interaction between diet, microbial composition, and immune responses in CD [@braun_2024].

The dataset comprises 40 samples: 20 from Crohn’s disease patients and 20 from non-CD controls. RNA-seq was performed on ileal tissue biopsies from these individuals, providing a comprehensive snapshot of gene expression differences linked to disease status. For this report, I will conduct a differential expression analysis between Crohn’s and non-Crohn’s patients to identify key genes and pathways associated with CD pathogenesis, with a particular interest in genes linked to diet-microbiome interactions and immune regulation [@braun_2024].

For reference, I used GitHub Copilot for code completion. I used Copilot primarily for commenting, writing cat/print statements, and completing the latter half of lines of code. While I wrote the core logic, Copilot helped speed up the coding process. I attempted to use it for debugging at times; however, it was largely unhelpful.

After downloading the data, I must first inspect `sample_info` to see how the “CD vs. non-CD” status is encoded. 
```{r message=FALSE}

# For each GSM object, we create a vector:
#   [ x@header$title, x@header$characteristics_ch1[1], x@header$characteristics_ch1[2], ... ]
# This will give each sample's annotation in separate columns rather than one long string.
sample_info <- do.call(
  rbind,
  lapply(gsms_list, function(x) {
    c(
      x@header$title,
      x@header$characteristics_ch1
    )
  })
)

# Convert to data frame
sample_info <- as.data.frame(sample_info)


colnames(sample_info) <- c(
  "title",         # e.g. "C487_TI2"
  "patient_id",    # e.g. "patient id: C487"
  "country",       # e.g. "country: China"
  "diagnosis",     # e.g. "diagosis: Control"
  "patient_group", # e.g. "patient group: Rural"
  "sex",           # e.g. "gender: female"
  "age",           # e.g. "age: 49"
  "bmi",           # e.g. "bmi: 20.44"
  "crp_mg_l"       # e.g. "crp mg_l: 2.67"
)

# Row names are the GSM IDs by default
head(sample_info)


#Minimal Control vs Non-Control Example

# rowname; title; desc
# GSM7438873 C487_TI2 patient id: C487; country: China; diagosis: Control; patient group: Rural; gender: female; age: 49; bmi: 20.44; crp mg_l: 2.67
# GSM7438874 D605_TI1           patient id: D605; country: China; diagosis: CD; patient group: CD; gender: male; age: 29; bmi: 20.31; crp mg_l: 4.65

```

We can print out the dataframe as the following:
```{r}
sample_info
```


The sample_info dataframe notes how control and non-control patients are encoded. This will be used for the quality assessment and general pre-normalization steps in the next section. We will be using all 40 samples (20 Crohn’s, 20 non-Crohn’s) to increase statistical power and better captures biological variability within each group.


#Quality Assessment and Cleaning

First, I start by extracting only the attributes I am interested in. The methods from this code block is nearly identical to the code from lecture 4[@isserlin_2025]. 
```{r}
sample_info <- sample_info[, c("diagnosis", "patient_group", "sex", "age")]

# Remove text prefixes (adjust these patterns if necessary)
sample_info$diagnosis     <- gsub("diagosis: ", "", sample_info$diagnosis)
sample_info$patient_group <- gsub("patient group: ", "", sample_info$patient_group)
sample_info$sex           <- gsub("gender: ", "", sample_info$sex)
sample_info$age           <- gsub("age: ", "", sample_info$age)

# Double checking each row only contains CD or Control
sample_info <- sample_info[sample_info$diagnosis %in% c("CD", "Control"), ]
```


The supplemental file retrieved from getGEOSuppFiles, GSE233900_RAW.tar, only contained TPM data. As such, to download the raw counts for normalization analysis I fetched the count data directly from the NCBI website instead. The count url was derived by going to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE233900 and copying the hyperlink attached to GSE233900_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz.
```{r}
# Downloading supplemental files into GSE233900/GSE233900_RAW.tar
# getGEOSuppFiles(gse_id, fetch_files = TRUE)

raw_counts_url <- "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?type=rnaseq_counts&acc=GSE233900&format=file&file=GSE233900_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz"

# Download the file (uncomment and adjust if needed)
download.file(raw_counts_url, destfile = "GSE233900_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz")

# Read the raw count data into R
raw_counts <- read.table(gzfile("GSE233900_raw_counts_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv.gz"), 
                         header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(raw_counts)

```

The column names in the count matrix correspond exactly with the GSM IDs in sample_info.

Now we can filter out genes with low expression. First we must prepare the count matrix.
```{r}
# If the first column contains gene IDs, set them as row names and remove that column
rownames(raw_counts) <- raw_counts[,1]
raw_counts <- raw_counts[, -1]

# Check the dimensions and structure
dim(raw_counts)
str(raw_counts)

# Convert raw_counts to a numeric matrix
raw_counts_matrix <- as.matrix(raw_counts)
mode(raw_counts_matrix) <- "numeric"
```

To examine the quality of the data, and whether it is suitable for this assignment, we can note the differences in the data before and after filtering.
```{r}

library_sizes <- colSums(raw_counts_matrix)
boxplot(library_sizes, main = "Library Size Distribution", ylab = "Total Counts")

plot_densities_by_sample <- function(dat, xlab, ylab, main) {
  densities_by_sample <- apply(log2(dat + 1), 2, density)
  x_lim <- range(sapply(densities_by_sample, function(x) x$x))
  y_lim <- range(sapply(densities_by_sample, function(x) x$y))
  cols <- rainbow(ncol(dat))
  
  par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 10))  # Increase right margin space
  plot(densities_by_sample[[1]], xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim, 
       type = "n", xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, main = main)
  for (i in 1:length(densities_by_sample)) {
    lines(densities_by_sample[[i]], col = cols[i])
  }
  
  # Adding legend outside the density plot
  legend("topright", inset = c(-0.3, 0), legend = colnames(dat), 
         col = cols, lty = 1, cex = 0.5, ncol = 2, xpd = TRUE)
}

plot_densities_by_sample(cpm(raw_counts_matrix), 
                         xlab = "CPM", 
                         ylab = "Density", 
                         main = "Density Plot of Raw Counts (Before Filtering)")

boxplot(log2(cpm(raw_counts_matrix) + 1), xlab = "", ylab = "log2 CPM",
        las = 2, cex = 0.5, cex.lab = 1, cex.axis = 0.5, 
        main = "Boxplot of Counts Before Filtering")

mtext("Samples", side = 1, line = 4)

```
To analyze the quality of the data before filtering, I plotted a box plot for library size, a density plot of the raw counts, and a box plot of the counts.

The total counts per sample appear relatively uniform, with one  outlier. Since there are no extreme variations, there is likely no major technical issues with sequencing depth. Since the one outlier is only slightly outside of the whiskers, it does not immediately suggest a technical artifact or to remove the sample. If one sample clusters separately in later analysis, and it is this sample, this might more of a consideration. 

The boxplot shows the log2-transformed CPM values across samples. The distribution appears consistent across samples, indicating no major batch effects and while there are some outliers (dots above the whiskers), given the volume of the RNA-seq data, a seemingly large number of outliers is expected before filtering. The median expression levels are comparable across samples which means the data is well distributed.

The density plot shows a bimodal distribution, which is typical for RNA-seq data. I expect that peak near 0 CPM corresponds to lowly expressed genes, which should be filtered, and the other noting moderately to highly expressed genes in the dataset. The curves are overlapping, indicating no major discrepancies between samples. This suggests that all samples were processed under similar conditions, potentially making differential expression analysis more reliable. 

The plots suggest that the experimental conditions for creating the data were high quality.

Now, we can filter out lowly expressed genes. By modifying the procedure from lecture[@isserlin_2025], we aim to keep genes with at least 1 CPM in at least a certain number of samples. While 4 samples may be a low number, after later analysis of HUGO symbols there were a relatively low number of genes remaining. Hence, the threshold was decreased to 4 temporarily from 9.
```{r}
# Calculating CPM values and filtering genes
# Keeping genes with at least 1 CPM in at least 4 samples
keep_genes <- rowSums(cpm(raw_counts_matrix) > 1) >= 4
filtered_counts <- raw_counts_matrix[keep_genes, ]
```

Now we want to examine the effects of the filtering by modifying the code from lecture [@isserlin_2025] for density plots.
```{r}
# Examining Dimensions
cat("Dimensions before filtering:", dim(raw_counts_matrix), "\n")
cat("Dimensions after filtering:", dim(filtered_counts), "\n")


# Count how many genes have zero counts across all samples
zero_count_genes <- sum(rowSums(raw_counts_matrix) == 0)

# Count how many genes have low expression (less than 1 CPM in all samples)
low_expressed_genes <- sum(rowSums(cpm(raw_counts_matrix) > 1) < 1)

cat("Total genes before filtering:", nrow(raw_counts_matrix), "\n")
cat("Genes with zero counts in all samples before:", zero_count_genes, "\n")
cat("Genes with very low expression (CPM < 1 in all samples):", low_expressed_genes, "\n")

plot_densities_by_sample(cpm(filtered_counts), 
                         xlab = "log2 CPM", 
                         ylab = "Density", 
                         main = "Density Plot of Filtered Counts")

boxplot(log2(cpm(filtered_counts) + 1), xlab = "", ylab = "log2 CPM",
        las = 2, cex = 0.5, cex.lab = 1, cex.axis = 0.5, 
        main = "Boxplot of Counts After Filtering")

mtext("Samples", side = 1, line = 4)

```
Before filtering there were 39376 genes, after filtering there are now 19118 genes. Compared to the unfiltered density plot, the increase in the second peak suggests that lowly expressed genes have been removed largely successfully. The box plot of counts after filtering notes almost no changes which is expected, some changes to the median of each sample is expected after normalization [@isserlin_2025].

Dimensions before filtering: 39376 40 
Dimensions after filtering: 19118 40 
Total genes before filtering: 39376 
Genes with zero counts in all samples: 4531 
Genes with very low expression (CPM < 1 in all samples): 18752 


# Normalization

After deciding on the data set, we can construct an edgeR DGEList object using the filtered count matrix and define groupings for CD vs control. Afterwards, we calculate normalization factors using the TMM method, as noted in class [@isserlin_2025].
```{r}
group <- factor(sample_info$diagnosis)

dge <- DGEList(counts = filtered_counts, group = group)
# dge$samples

# TMM normalization factors
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)

dge$samples

norm_cpm <- cpm(dge)

```

To observe how the distribution of the data changed, we can plot the data after normalization.
```{r}
log_normalized_cpm <- log2(norm_cpm + 1) # +1 for no log of 0


# Density plot 
plot_densities_by_sample(norm_cpm, 
                         xlab = "log2 CPM", 
                         ylab = "Density", 
                         main = "Density Plot of Normalized Counts")

# Boxplot: Distribution of Samples After Normalization
boxplot(log2(norm_cpm + 1), xlab = "", ylab = "log2 CPM",
        las = 2, cex = 0.5, cex.lab = 1, cex.axis = 0.5, 
        main = "Boxplots of Counts After Normalization")
mtext("Samples", side = 1, line = 4)


# MDS Plot: Checking Sample Clustering
limma::plotMDS(dge, labels = NULL, 
               main = "MDS Plot of CD vs. Control Samples",
               pch = 1, cex = 1.5, 
               col = c("blue", "darkgreen")[factor(sample_info$diagnosis)])
legend("topright", legend = levels(factor(sample_info$diagnosis)), 
       pch = 1, col = c("blue", "darkgreen"), bty = "n", cex = 0.75)

# BCV Plot: Dispersion Estimation
dge <- estimateDisp(dge, model.matrix(~ factor(sample_info$diagnosis)))
plotBCV(dge, col.tagwise = "black", col.common = "red", 
               main = "BCV Plot for Normalized Counts (Diagnosis Grouping)")

# Mean-Variance Plot: Checking Negative Binomial Assumption
plotMeanVar(dge, show.raw.vars = TRUE, 
                   show.tagwise.vars = TRUE, NBline = TRUE, 
                   show.ave.raw.vars = TRUE, 
                   show.binned.common.disp.vars = TRUE,
                   main = "Mean-Variance Plot of Normalized Count Data")

```
Density plot: The density plot looks largely the same shape as the filtered counts graph before normalization. This is good since it suggests again that there are few technical problems or artifacts.

Box plot: The medians of each sample appear slightly closer together after TMM normalization than the original, as expected [@isserlin_2025]. Otherwise, not too many changes.

MDS plot: Visualizing the similarity between samples based on their gene expression profiles, CD (Crohn’s Disease) samples (blue) and Control samples (green) form distinct clusters, indicating clear separation in gene expression patterns between conditions. The first dimension (x-axis) explains 27% of the variation, while the second (y-axis) explains 15%, meaning most of the group separation is along the x-axis. Some overlap exists, but overall, the separation suggests that differential expression analysis should yield biologically meaningful results.

BCV plot: The shape of the BCV plot suggests that genes with low expression levels have higher variability, while genes with high expression levels have lower variability. This is to be expected of quality data [@isserlin_2025]. The trend line (blue) follows a decreasing pattern as expression levels increase, which is expected in properly processed RNA-seq data. The common dispersion (red line) remains relatively stable, providing an overall estimate of variability across genes.


# Mapping to HUGO

Setting up biomaRt. The dataset used in lecture, hsapiens_gene_ensembl, is used here [@isserlin_2025]. Throughout the duration of this assignment, there have been server side biomaRt issues. If "! Your query has been redirected to http://status.ensembl.org indicating this Ensembl service is currently unavailable." occurs, rerun the block at a later time and it should function.
```{r}
ensembl <- useMart("ensembl")
```

This code has been separated from the code above since the BioMart connection is unstable at times. Re-running this code block multiple times works on my 2021 Apple M1 Pro, in the worst cases I have only had to re-run the block 4 times. I have had more success after installing the latest version of biomaRt; however, it is not necessary.
```{r}
# Uncomment to download latest version of biomaRt
# BiocManager::install("biomaRt") 

# Uncomment to use different mirror
# ensembl_human <- useEnsembl(biomart = "genes", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl", mirror = "uswest")


ensembl_human <- useDataset("hsapiens_gene_ensembl", mart = ensembl)
```


Next, we must retrieve a list of available filters in the Ensembl BioMart database, extract filters related to Entrez Gene IDs, and search for attributes related to Entrez and HGNC symbols to ensure they are available for gene ID mapping.
```{r}
# Listing available filters to verify the Entrez filter
biomart_human_filters <- listFilters(ensembl_human)
entrez_filters <- biomart_human_filters[grep("entrez", biomart_human_filters$name),]


# Searching for attributes related to Entrez and HGNC
entrez_attributes <- searchAttributes(mart = ensembl_human, pattern = "entrez")
hgnc_attributes <- searchAttributes(mart = ensembl_human, pattern = "hgnc")


# entrez_attributes 
# hgnc_attributes
```
The attributes we are interested in are "entrezgene_id" and "hgnc_symbol" since they allow us to map the NCBI entrez identifiers to HUGO symbols.

Similar to the biomaRt connection problems, id_conversion may error noting "HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed". Despite the error suggesting there is a request issue, it appears to be a biomaRt server side issue. Re-running the code block multiple times works similar to above, worst recorded case required rerunning 3 times. The latest version of biomaRt is less prone to this error; however, it is not necessary. This code is a modified variation of lecture material [@isserlin_2025].


Next, we retrieve HGNC symbols for a list of Entrez Gene IDs extracted from the row names of norm_cpm using the Ensembl BioMart database.
```{r}
# BiocManager::install("biomaRt")

ids_to_convert <- rownames(norm_cpm)

id_conversion <- getBM(attributes = c("entrezgene_id", "hgnc_symbol"),
                       filters = "entrezgene_id",
                       values = ids_to_convert,
                       mart = ensembl_human)

```


Then, we merge the Entrez-to-HGNC mapping (id_conversion) with the normalized gene expression data (norm_cpm), matching on Entrez Gene IDs, and keep all rows from norm_cpm.
```{r}
# Merge the mapping with normalized counts.
norm_cpm_annot <- merge(id_conversion, 
                                 norm_cpm, 
                                 by.x = "entrezgene_id", 
                                 by.y = 0, 
                                 all.y = TRUE)

head(norm_cpm_annot)

```

To clean the data so that we only have genes with a HGNC symbol, lets see how many genes of that kind there are.
```{r}
# Count how many rows have NA for the HGNC symbol.
num_NA <- sum(is.na(norm_cpm_annot$hgnc_symbol))
cat("Number of genes with NA HGNC symbol:", num_NA, "\n")

# Display the first 10 gene IDs with NA HGNC symbols.
head(norm_cpm_annot[is.na(norm_cpm_annot$hgnc_symbol), "entrezgene_id"], 10)

```
The 2363 genes which don't have a HGNC symbol must be removed since they are not compatable with our intended pipeline [@isserlin_2025].

```{r}
# Removing rows with NA HGNC symbols.
norm_cpm_annot_mapped <- norm_cpm_annot[!is.na(norm_cpm_annot$hgnc_symbol),]

# Removing rows with blank HGNC symbols.
norm_cpm_annot_mapped <- norm_cpm_annot_mapped[norm_cpm_annot_mapped$hgnc_symbol != "",]

cat("Dimensions after removing unmapped genes:", dim(norm_cpm_annot_mapped), "\n")

```

Now we want to handle duplicate hgnc symbols.  
```{r}
cat("Unique HGNC symbols:", length(unique(norm_cpm_annot_mapped$hgnc_symbol)), "\n")
cat("Total rows:", nrow(norm_cpm_annot_mapped), "\n")
```

Since there are 16503 - 16408 = 95 duplicates (the number of total minus number of uniques is duplicates), lets address them. As noted in class, some genes have multiple transcript variants that map to the same gene symbol [@isserlin_2025]. For differential expression, we want to maintain total gene expression since the RNA-seq tools we use (edgeR, DESeq2, etc) assume total counts not averages.
```{r}
# Ensure hgnc_symbol is correctly recognized as a column
if (!"hgnc_symbol" %in% colnames(norm_cpm_annot_mapped)) {
  stop("hgnc_symbol column not found. Check column names.")
}

# Group and sum across all numeric expression columns
# Note that entrezgene_id and hgnc_symbol are removed since non-numeric columns
norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean <- norm_cpm_annot_mapped %>%
  group_by(hgnc_symbol) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  ungroup()

norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean <- as.data.frame(norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean)

# Setting row names to HGNC symbols
rownames(norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean) <- norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean$hgnc_symbol
norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean <- norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean[ , -1]  # Remove hgnc_symbol column

dim(norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean) # [1] 16408    40
# norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean
cat("Unique HGNC symbols:", length(unique(norm_cpm_annot_mapped$hgnc_symbol)), "\n")
```
The final dimensions note exactly the number of unique genes which suggests the duplicates have been handled correctly.

# Interpretation & Questions
After normalizing and mapping the data to HUGO symbols, we can answer the overarching assignment related questions.

## 1. What are the control and test conditions of the dataset?
The dataset comprises 20 samples each from Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and non-CD controls. The diagnosis column in sample_info is used in the code above to distinguish each group of samples.

## 2. Why is the dataset of interest to you?
Crohn's disease is often initially diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBD). As someone with IBD, I wanted to learn more about how people are researching Crohn's and in some senses IBD. I used to not be able to eat any food at all but after a lot of effort from doctors I have made significant improvements. Through examining this data set, I am looking to learn more about how Crohn's and IBD works as well as be more informed about the genetic components of the affliction.

## 3. Were there expression values that were not unique for specific genes? How did you handle these?
Duplicate HGNC symbols, 95, were found because multiple transcript variants can map to the same gene. To handle these, I used dplyr to group by hgnc_symbol and summed the expression values across duplicate entries. This ensured that each gene was represented by a single row with the total expression count. This can be found at the end of the "Mapping to HUGO" section and is handled via the code noted below.

norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean <- norm_cpm_annot_mapped %>%
  group_by(hgnc_symbol) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  ungroup()


## 4. Were there expression values that could not be mapped to current HUGO symbols?
Yes, 2363 genes could not be mapped to current HGNC symbols. I identified these by counting rows where hgnc_symbol was NA or blank and then removed them. They were handled via the code below.

num_NA <- sum(is.na(norm_cpm_annot$hgnc_symbol))
norm_cpm_annot_mapped <- norm_cpm_annot[!is.na(norm_cpm_annot$hgnc_symbol),]
norm_cpm_annot_mapped <- norm_cpm_annot_mapped[norm_cpm_annot_mapped$hgnc_symbol != "",]

# 5. How many outliers were removed?
This answer assumes outliers pertain to the low expression genes that were filtered out [@isserlin_2025] or samples with a much larger library size.

With regards to low expression, prior to filtering there were 39376 genes and after filtering 19118 remained. As such, 20 258 outliers were removed.

No samples noted a library size large enough to be removed from the analysis.

# 6. How did you handle replicates?
Replicates were maintained as individual samples throughout the analysis. I retained all 40 samples (20 CD and 20 Control) in the count matrix so that the within-group biological variability is preserved for downstream differential expression analysis.

# 7. What is the final coverage of your dataset?
The output of the code below noted 40 samples and 16408 genes. Hence, the coverage is 16408 genes.

dim(norm_cpm_annot_mapped_clean) # Output: [1] 16408    40
