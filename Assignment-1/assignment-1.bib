  abstract = {Abstract             Microarray technology has become a standard molecular biology tool. Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.             Availability: GEOquery is available as part of the BioConductor project.             Contact: ~sdavis2@mail.nih.gov},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background and Aim               We aimed to assess the gene expression profiles of nonlesional small bowels in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) to identify its accompanying molecular alterations.                                         Methods               We performed RNA sequencing of the uninflamed small bowel tissues obtained from 70 patients with ileal CD and 9 patients with colon cancer (non‐CD controls) during bowel resection. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses were performed using DESeq2. Gene set enrichment, correlation, and cell deconvolution analyses were applied to identify modules and functionally enriched transcriptional signatures of CD.                                         Results                                A comparison of CD patients and non‐CD controls revealed that of the 372 DEGs, 49 protein‐coding genes and 5 long non‐coding RNAs overlapped with the inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility loci. The pathways related to immune and inflammatory reactions were upregulated in CD, while metabolic pathways were downregulated in CD. Compared with non‐CD controls, CD patients had significantly higher proportions of immune cells, including plasma cells (                 P                 ~=~1.15~×~10                 −4                 ), and a lower proportion of epithelial cells (                 P                 ~=~1.12~×~10                 −4                 ). Co‐upregulated genes (M14 module) and co‐downregulated genes (M9 module) were identified in CD patients. The M14 module was enriched in immune‐related genes and significantly associated with the responses to anti‐tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. The core signature of the M14 module was comprised of six genes and was upregulated in nonresponders to anti‐TNF therapy of five independent cohorts (                 n                 ~=~163), indicating acceptable discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 75–86\%).                                                        Conclusions               The differences in gene expression and cellular composition between CD patients and non‐CD controls imply significant molecular alterations, which are associated with the response to anti‐TNF treatment.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Acoustic startle response (ASR) assesses hyperarousal, a core symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Intranasal neuropeptide Y (NPY) administration was shown to prevent hyperarousal in single prolonged stress (SPS) rodent PTSD model. However, it is unclear how ASR itself alters responses to stress. Rats (A‐S‐A) were exposed to acoustic startle (AS) 1 day before SPS (ASR1) and 2 weeks afterward (ASR2). Other groups were exposed in parallel to either AS (A‐A) or SPS or neither. SPS enhanced ASR2. In relevant brain areas, mRNA levels were determined by qRT‐PCR. In mediobasal hypothalamus, AS or SPS each increased CRH mRNA levels without an additive effect. Exposure to AS appeared to dampen some responses to SPS. The SPS‐triggered reduction of GR and FKBP5 gene expression was not observed in A‐S‐A group. In locus coeruleus, SPS increased CRHR1 and reduced Y2R mRNAs, but not in A‐S‐A group. In both regions, AS altered NPY receptor gene expression, which may mediate dampening responses to SPS. In second experiment, intranasal NPY administered 2 weeks after SPS reversed hyperarousal symptoms for at least 7 days. This study reveals important effects of AS on the NPY system and demonstrates that intranasal NPY elicits long‐lasting reversal of traumatic stress–triggered hyperarousal.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Biologists need to perform complex queries, often across a variety of databases. Typically, each data resource provides an advanced query interface, each of which must be learnt by the biologist before they can begin to query them. Frequently, more than one data source is required and for high-throughput analysis, cutting and pasting results between websites is certainly very time consuming. Therefore, many groups rely on local bioinformatics support to process queries by accessing the resource's programmatic interfaces if they exist. This is not an efficient solution in terms of cost and time. Instead, it would be better if the biologist only had to learn one generic interface. BioMart provides such a solution.                                         Results               BioMart enables scientists to perform advanced querying of biological data sources through a single web interface. The power of the system comes from integrated querying of data sources regardless of their geographical locations. Once these queries have been defined, they may be automated with its "scripting at the click of a button" functionality. BioMart's capabilities are extended by integration with several widely used software packages such as BioConductor, DAS, Galaxy, Cytoscape, Taverna. In this paper, we describe all aspects of BioMart from a user's perspective and demonstrate how it can be used to solve real biological use cases such as SNP selection for candidate gene screening or annotation of microarray results.                                         Conclusion                                BioMart is an easy to use, generic and scalable system and therefore, has become an integral part of large data resources including Ensembl, UniProt, HapMap, Wormbase, Gramene, Dictybase, PRIDE, MSD and Reactome. BioMart is freely accessible to use at                 http://www.biomart.org                 .},
