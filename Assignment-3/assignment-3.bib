  abstract = {AIM: To evaluate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in colonic pathophysiology as they had recently been related to colorectal cancer (CRC) development. METHODS: Literature search was conducted on PubMed using combinations of the following terms: ABC transporters, ATP binding cassette transporter proteins, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative, colitis, Crohn's disease, colorectal cancer, colitis, intestinal inflammation, intestinal carcinogenesis, ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp/CD243/MDR1), ABCC2/multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), Abcb1/Mdr1a, abcc2/Mrp2, abcg2/Bcrp, knock-out mice, tight junction, membrane lipid function. RESULTS: Recently, human studies reported that changes in the levels of ABC transporters were early events in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence leading to CRC. A link between ABCB1, high fat diet and gut microbes in relation to colitis was suggested by the animal studies. The finding that colitis was preceded by altered gut bacterial composition suggests that deletion of Abcb1 leads to fundamental changes of host-microbiota interaction. Also, high fat diet increases the frequency and severity of colitis in specific pathogen-free Abcb1 KO mice. The Abcb1 KO mice might thus serve as a model in which diet/environmental factors and microbes may be controlled and investigated in relation to intestinal inflammation. Potential molecular mechanisms include defective transport of inflammatory mediators and/or phospholipid translocation from one side to the other of the cell membrane lipid bilayer by ABC transporters affecting inflammatory response and/or function of tight junctions, phagocytosis and vesicle trafficking. Also, diet and microbes give rise to molecules which are potential substrates for the ABC transporters and which may additionally affect ABC transporter function through nuclear receptors and transcriptional regulation. Another critical role of ABCB1 was suggested by the finding that ABCB1 expression identifies a subpopulation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells which were resistant to treatment with glucocorticoids. The evidence for the involvement of ABCC2 and ABCG2 in colonic pathophysiology was weak. CONCLUSION: ABCB1, diet, and gut microbes mutually interact in colonic inflammation, a well-known risk factor for CRC. Further insight may be translated into preventive and treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               IL-23 is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and myeloid cells that express Fc{$\gamma$}RI (CD64) have been identified as the primary cellular source of IL-23 in inflamed IBD gut tissue. Guselkumab (GUS) and risankizumab (RZB) are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically directed against the IL-23p19 subunit. GUS is a fully human IgG1 mAb with a native Fc region while RZB is a humanized IgG1 mAb with a mutated Fc region. Here, we evaluated CD64 and IL-23 expression in IBD patient gut biopsies, binding of GUS and RZB to CD64, and the functional consequences of CD64 binding by IL-23p19 subunit mAbs, in in vitro assays.                                         Methods               IL23A and FCGR1A (CD64) expression was analyzed from bulk and single-cell RNAseq datasets. Binding of mAbs to IFN{$\gamma$}-primed human monocytes, as well as binding to IL-23--secreting inflammatory monocytes and capture of endogenously secreted IL-23, were assessed by flow cytometry. Internalization of IL-23, GUS, and RZB within CD64+ macrophages was evaluated using live cell confocal imaging. Potency of GUS and RZB for inhibiting IL-23 signaling was determined in a co-culture of THP-1 (a CD64+ monocyte cell line activated to produce IL-23) and an IL-23 reporter cell line (measuring biologically active IL-23).                                         Results               Analysis of RNAseq datasets showed that FCGR1A, IL23A, and IL12B were significantly increased in inflamed versus non-inflamed IBD gut biopsies and that IL23A was predominantly expressed by FCGR1A-expressing myeloid cells. In in vitro assays GUS, but not RZB, showed Fc-mediated binding to CD64 on IFN{$\gamma$}-primed monocytes. CD64-bound GUS simultaneously captured IL-23 secreted from the same cells. GUS, but not RZB, bound to the surface of CD64+ macrophages and mediated internalization of IL-23 to low pH intracellular compartments. GUS and RZB demonstrated similar potency for inhibiting signaling by IL-23 present in THP-1--conditioned media. However, in a co-culture of IL-23--producing THP-1 cells with an IL-23--responsive reporter cell line, GUS demonstrated enhanced potency compared to RZB for inhibition of IL-23 signaling.                                         Conclusion               Our transcriptomic analysis supported previous observations of CD64+ myeloid cells as a key source of IL-23 production in inflamed IBD gut tissue. GUS binding to CD64 on IL-23--producing cells likely contributed to the enhanced functional potency of GUS compared to RZB for inhibition of IL-23 signaling in the co-culture assay. These in vitro data support a hypothesis for optimal enrichment of GUS in inflamed tissues where CD64+ IL-23--producing myeloid cells are increased and in proximity to IL-23--responsive lymphoid cells, enabling GUS to more potently neutralize IL-23 by targeting IL-23 at its source of production.},

The Study Of Urban and Rural CD Evolution (SOURCE, n\,=\,380) has considered diet-omics domains simultaneously to detect complex interactions and identify potential beneficial and pathogenic factors linked with rural-urban transition and CD. We characterize exposures, diet, ileal transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiome in newly diagnosed CD patients and controls in rural and urban China and Israel. We show that time spent by rural residents in urban environments is linked with changes in gut microbial composition and metabolomics, which mirror those seen in CD. Ileal transcriptomics highlights personal metabolic and immune gene expression modules, that are directly linked to potential protective dietary exposures (coffee, manganese, vitamin D), fecal metabolites, and the microbiome. Bacteria-associated metabolites are primarily linked with host immune modules, whereas diet-linked metabolites are associated with host epithelial metabolic functions.},

  abstract = {Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a computational biology method that identifies biological functions that are overrepresented in a group of genes more than would be expected by chance and ranks these functions by relevance. The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results. Our nine tips can help users perform better pathway enrichment analyses and eventually contribute to a better understanding of current biology.},

The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.

The experiment involved 96 Sprague--Dawley rats, which were divided into two main groups: control and TNBS-induced colitis. Both groups of rats were further divided into three dietary subgroups, which were fed with standard feed or feed supplemented with low- or high-molar-mass oat beta-glucans for 3 (reflecting acute inflammation) or 7 days (reflecting pre-remission). The gene expression of chemokines and their receptors in the colon wall was determined by RT-PCR, and the expression of selected proteins in the mucosa was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that acute and pre-remission stages of colitis were characterized by the increased gene expression of seven chemokines and four chemokine receptors in the colon wall as well as disrupted protein expression of CXCL1, CCL5, CXCR2, CCR5, and OPN in the mucosa. The consumption of oat beta-glucans resulted in decreased expression of most of these genes and modulated the expression of all proteins, with a stronger effect observed with the use of high-molar-mass beta-glucan. To summarize, dietary oat beta-glucans, particularly those of high molar mass, can reduce colitis by modulating the expression of chemokines and their receptors and certain proteins associated with CD.},

The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves defective innate immune responses, microbiome alterations, and dysregulated activation of the acquired component of mucosal immunity. One of the molecular mediators that is involved at different levels in the initiation and progression of intestinal inflammation characteristic of CD is tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The present manuscript provides a comprehensive review focused on the potential role of TNF in the different phases of CD pathogenesis, particularly in light of its potential clinical implications. Currently available drugs blocking TNF are evaluated and discussed, specifically for open issues that still remain utilizing such therapy. TNF exerts a paramount role in the established phase of intestinal inflammation that characterizes CD patients, and anti-TNF biologics have definitely changed patient management, offering effective and safe options of treatment. Nonetheless, many patients still do not respond to anti-TNF therapy or experience unwanted side-effects. This could partially be due to the role that TNF plays in intestinal homeostasis that is particularly important during the early phase of the inflammatory process. In fact, emerging evidence supporting the dichotomous role of TNF and the identification of molecular markers will guide a more tailored and refined therapy for CD patients in the near future.},

This is not an efficient solution in terms of cost and time. Instead, it would be better if the biologist only had to learn one generic interface. BioMart provides such a solution.                                         Results               BioMart enables scientists to perform advanced querying of biological data sources through a single web interface. The power of the system comes from integrated querying of data sources regardless of their geographical locations. Once these queries have been defined, they may be automated with its "scripting at the click of a button" functionality. BioMart's capabilities are extended by integration with several widely used software packages such as BioConductor, DAS, Galaxy, Cytoscape, Taverna. In this paper, we describe all aspects of BioMart from a user's perspective and demonstrate how it can be used to solve real biological use cases such as SNP selection for candidate gene screening or annotation of microarray results.                                         Conclusion                                BioMart is an easy to use, generic and scalable system and therefore, has become an integral part of large data resources including Ensembl, UniProt, HapMap, Wormbase, Gramene, Dictybase, PRIDE, MSD and Reactome. BioMart is freely accessible to use at                 http://www.biomart.org                 .},

  abstract = {Patients presenting with Inflammatory bowel disease have been shown to exhibit an altered microbiome in both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis. This shift in the microbial content led us to question whether several of these microbes are important in inflammatory processes present in these diseases and more specifically whether lipopolysaccharides from the gram-negative cell wall differentially stimulates resident cells. We, therefore, investigated the possible contribution of five major species of gram-negative bacteria found to be altered in presence during disease progression and evaluate their pathogenicity through LPS. We demonstrated that LPS from these different species had individual capacities to induce NF-{$\kappa$}B and pro-inflammatory IL-8 production from HEK-TLR4 cells in a TLR4 dependent manner. Additional work using human intestinal colonic epithelial cell monolayers (Caco-2) demonstrated that the cells responded to the serotype specific LPS in a distinct manner, inducing many inflammatory mediators such as TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-10 in significantly altered proportions. Furthermore, the permeability of Caco-2 monolayers, as a test for their ability to alter intestinal permeability, was also differentially altered by the serotype specific LPS modulating trans-epithelial electrical resistance, small molecule movement, and tight junction integrity. Our results suggest that specific species of bacteria may be potentiating the pathogenesis of IBD and chronic inflammatory diseases through their serotype specific LPS responses.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To encapsulate our current understanding of the proinflammatory cytokines responsible for the inflammation underlying Crohn's disease and the prospect of using this information to devise therapy for this condition based on inhibition of these cytokines. RECENT FINDINGS: Current research is shedding new light on the role of both T helper cell (Th)1 and Th17 responses in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Initial studies conducted a decade ago highlighted the view that Crohn's disease inflammation is caused by an interleukin-12-driven Th1 response, which resulted in the generation of interferon-gamma, which then served as the main inflammatory mediator. In recent years, however, this view has been largely eclipsed by studies, conducted mainly in murine models, showing that a Th17 response is the main cause of Crohn's disease inflammation through the production of interleukin-17. Now, a somewhat more balanced view is emerging, which holds that interferon-gamma is still a major proinflammatory cytokine in Crohn's disease, although it may arise from both the Th1 and Th17-mediated responses at different phases of the inflammatory process. SUMMARY: The new findings continue to support the idea that anti-interleukin-12p40, an antibody that inhibits both the Th1 and Th17 response, is logically the most potent anticytokine for the treatment of Crohn's disease.},

  abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  abstract = {This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: - produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification - superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales - add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression - save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse - create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots - approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{$<$} - Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system - New scales, stats and geoms added throughout - Additional practice exercises - A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() - Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},
